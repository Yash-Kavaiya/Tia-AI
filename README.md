## Security Considerations

- Implement end-to-end encryption for all communications
- Use secure API authentication for all service integrations
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Apply principle of least privilege for all service accounts
- Comply with telecom regulatory requirements for data protection
- Implement session management with appropriate timeouts
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Deployment Strategy

- Use infrastructure as code (Terraform) for consistent environments
- Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Use blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates
- Implement monitoring and alerting for all critical components
- Create separate development, staging, and production environments
- Automated rollback capability for failed deployments
